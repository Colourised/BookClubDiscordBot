# TODO
# 1. seperate datetime object and begin using it for conditionals
    - idk if i need to seperate it as the methods provided allow access to day and month can just test the return value
# 2. send progress reminders to users to keep them on track -- simple extension of loops once i have datetime object broken
# 3. at end of month maybe i send a message and disscusion questions in order to stimulate conversation
# 4. eventually get books to autochange and rotate through selections as new month hits
# 4b) example: on 1st at 9am sends message >>> this month you are reading XYZ it is XYZ pages long, good luck have fun
# 4c) maybe api implementation here? book api to pull book title and length maybe a brief sysnopsis even -- this could be fun

#possible features?
#add commands for check ins
#add commands for finishing the book -- have has with everyones username and just a simple 1 or 0 for done or not
