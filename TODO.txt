TODO ----
1. Refactor my GETTER so I pull from API and update book variables at same time
2. Add optional month command to !bookinfo allowing to pull info for any month -- will need seperate API GETTER
    --GET based on month
3. Add all users in "guild" (name for server in discordpy)
    a) allows to set book status -- can set finished -- not done and prompts change based on this
4. Clean up usecases 
    - lower all text in commands to avoid breaks
    - capitalize book titles for appearance


NOTES ---
Book APIs are trash wanted to add page number and ratings but not willing to parse xml to do it so probably limited
    -- could potentially use google books but query results arent consistent
    -- goodreads json - google!


#possible features?
#add commands for check ins
#add commands for finishing the book -- have has with everyones username and just a simple 1 or 0 for done or not
    -- if adding this can start to have a leaderboard in further implementation to make it feel competitive -- maybe poke fun at last person done book
    -- do i hardcore our names or use the discord features in order to add users (if i wanna share the bot for others this is a must) -- second step maybe
    -- discussion questions
