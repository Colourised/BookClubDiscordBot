TODO ----
DONE -- 1. bookShelf and clubMember objects
    -bookShelf can hold collection of month:book and pull info from shelf instead of variable in main
    -clubMember can track members being finished or not and populate on intial load
        -allows for mods .finished() .reset() .status() .getMembers()
        -replace checkAllFinished function
TODO 2. Add date.endOfMonth() --> bool 
    -will make end of month loop only occur if actual last day of month instead of hardcode 30th
4. Clean up usecases
    - lower all text in commands to avoid breaks
    - capitalize book titles for appearance
5. Request for PM reminders
    - !reminder <freq in days>
    - potential implementation
        -save "reminder : yes/ no" in user dict
        -if yes checks interval and sends message if interval has passed
            -save intial date sent -- send if time since last message >= <freq in days>
